1.	The sequential search appears to have a time complexity proportional to n^2.
2.	The binary search only has a slight increase in time complexity with increased input, proportional to about log(n).
3.	The sequential search would not have been impacted significantly, but the insertion for the binary search has linear performance. Therefore the binary search operations would increase linearly.
